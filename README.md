# ML-algoriths-from-scratch

we have written Machine Learning algorithms using numpy and pandas module only.

ML algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, K-means clustering, PCA(principal component analysis), Decision Trees, Random forest, Logistic regression

Metrics: WCSS(within cluster sum of square), precision, recall, confusion matrix
